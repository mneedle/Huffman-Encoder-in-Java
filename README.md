# Huffman-Encoder-in-Java
This is a Huffman Encoder project that I completed in Java as part of an NYU course I took in Spring 2020. In this assignment, I implement a scheme for encoding and decoding text into and from a Huffman tree where each character is represented by a unique string of 8 bits.

# Instructions to Run
Once you download the java files in the "src" folder, you should be able to run the converter by typing "java <package.>HuffmanConverter" and then the name of a .txt file in the command like. For instance, you can download the .txt files in the "samples" folder, which are love poems taken from the website http://www.lovepoemsandquotes.com.
